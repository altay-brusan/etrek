# Copilot Developer Agent

The **Copilot Developer Agent** is designed to assist the engineering team by providing intelligent code suggestions, automating repetitive development tasks, and enforcing repository-wide conventions.

It integrates directly into our GitHub project and development pipelines to:
- Analyze pull requests and suggest improvements based on project guidelines.
- Generate boilerplate code, documentation, and test scaffolding.
- Ensure consistent coding standards and architectural alignment.
- Reduce development cycle time by offering in-context recommendations.

Future updates will extend the agentâ€™s role to include performance profiling, automated refactor proposals, and integration with CI/CD health metrics.
