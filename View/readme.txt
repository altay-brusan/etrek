 * @brief This package contains UI elements.
 *
 * Initially, having a dedicated project focused solely on UI may not seem necessary. 
 * However, transitioning from QWidget to QML in the future will require significant effort, 
 * making it advantageous to maintain a separate project for UI elements.
